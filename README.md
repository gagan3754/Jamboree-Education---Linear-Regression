Jamboree Education - Linear Regression

Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.
Drop the unique row Identifier if you see any. This step is important as you don’t want your model to build some understanding based on row numbers.
Use Non-graphical and graphical analysis for getting inferences about variables.
This can be done by checking the distribution of variables of graduate applicants.
Once you’ve ensured that students with varied merit apply for the university, you can start understanding the relationship between different factors responsible for graduate admissions.
Check correlation among independent variables and how they interact with each other.
Use Linear Regression from (Statsmodel library) and explain the results.
Test the assumptions of linear regression:
Multicollinearity check by VIF score
Mean of residuals
Linearity of variables (no pattern in residual plot)
Test for Homoscedasticity
Normality of residuals
Do model evaluation- MAE, RMSE, R2 score, Adjusted R2.
